> Added module*1 loading from the sd card and ported the base64 library from windows to the brain

> Made a new library called simplemenulib which added a 2 new ways to make menus one way was to manually create them another was to create a json file like the one [here](https://github.com/DylanBruner/2021-2022-Vex-Robot/blob/log/menu.json) and then use the library I made to load it

> Made a way to control the robot's drivetrain from a [computer](https://github.com/DylanBruner/2021-2022-Vex-Robot/blob/tools/rc_ish/controller.py)





*1 A module is base64 encoded code stored in sd-card/modules/<modulename>.module, it's base64 encoded to make updating them easier

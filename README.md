This will be a place were I write down what i did, maybe it wille be usefull in the notebook or somthing

[v1.0.1]

Got driving working, and started with a basic screen 


[v1.0.2]

Added module*1 loading from the sd card and ported the base64 library from windows to the brain
Made a new library called simplemenulib which added a 2 new ways to make menus one way was to manually create them another was to create a json file like the one [here](https://github.com/DylanBruner/2021-2022-Vex-Robot/blob/log/menu.json) and then use the library I made to load it








*1 A module is base64 encoded code stored in modules/<modulename>.module, it's base64 encoded to make updating them easier
